# Rate Limiting and Ticker Validation

This document explains the rate limiting improvements made to the ticker validation system to handle Yahoo Finance API limitations.

## Problem

The Yahoo Finance API has strict rate limiting that can cause 429 "Too Many Requests" errors when validating multiple tickers simultaneously. This was causing the universe management system to fail when users tried to validate multiple tickers at once.

## Solution

### 1. Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff

The ticker validation service now includes:
- **Retry Logic**: Up to 3 attempts for each ticker
- **Exponential Backoff**: Increasing delays between retries (1s, 2s, 4s)
- **Random Jitter**: Random delays to avoid thundering herd problems

### 2. Reduced Concurrency

- **Batch Size**: Limited to 2 tickers per batch
- **Single Worker**: One ticker validated at a time per batch
- **Inter-batch Delays**: 2-3 second delays between batches

### 3. Better Error Handling

- **HTTP 429 Detection**: Specific handling for rate limit errors
- **Graceful Degradation**: Clear error messages for users
- **Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging

## Configuration

The validation service can be configured with these parameters:

```python
TickerValidationService(
    timeout=15,      # Request timeout in seconds
    max_retries=3,   # Number of retry attempts
    base_delay=2.0   # Base delay between retries
)
```

## Usage Recommendations

### For Small Batches (1-5 tickers)
- Use the default settings
- Validation should complete in 10-30 seconds

### For Large Batches (10+ tickers)
- Consider breaking into smaller groups
- Allow more time between validations
- Monitor for rate limiting errors

## API Endpoints

The validation endpoint automatically uses the improved rate limiting:

```bash
POST /api/tickers/validate
Content-Type: application/json

["AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOGL", "INVALID"]
```

## Error Messages

Users will see clear error messages for different scenarios:

- **Rate Limited**: "Rate limited by Yahoo Finance API. Please try again later."
- **Invalid Ticker**: "No data available for this ticker"
- **Network Error**: "HTTP error: [status_code]"
- **Timeout**: "Failed to validate after multiple attempts"

## Monitoring

The service logs important events:
- Retry attempts with delays
- Rate limiting detection
- Batch processing progress
- Error details for debugging

## Best Practices

1. **Validate in Small Batches**: Don't try to validate 50+ tickers at once
2. **Allow Time Between Validations**: Wait a few seconds between large validation requests
3. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Show users clear error messages
4. **Monitor Logs**: Watch for rate limiting patterns

## Testing

Use the test script to verify the validation works:

```bash
cd backend
python test_ticker_validation.py
```

This will test validation with a small set of tickers and show the results.
