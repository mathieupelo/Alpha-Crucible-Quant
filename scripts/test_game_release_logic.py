Test script for the new game release date logic in sentiment calculation.

This script tests the filtering logic to ensure trailers are only considered
for games that haven't been released yet (with 7-day buffer).

NOTE: Sentiment calculation has been moved to the Signals repository.
This script is no longer functional in Alpha-Crucible-Quant.
